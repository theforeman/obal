usage: obal update [-h] [-v] [-e EXTRA_VARS] target [target ...]

Update a package to a newer version

The newer version is either taken from an upstream repository or can be given via command line options.

To update a package to a new version from the command line:

  obal update mypackage -e version=3.4.5

Updating a package that is taken from an upstream repository assumes that the package_manifest already defines the upstream location. Thus, the command line to update to a newer version that is available upstream automatically is:

  obal update mypackage
