  Build a SRPM for packages

  Building source RPMs can be useful when locally building packages. For
  example, when you've made local changes.

    --source-system local-bundle-rake --source-location $HOME/foreman-installer

  Not all projects need bundler so it's possible to run without.

    --source-system local-bundle-rake --source-location $HOME/smart-proxy

  It is also possible to retrieve the source from a Jenkins job.

    --source-system jenkins --source-location https://ci.theforeman.org/job/foreman-installer-develop-source-release

  build_srpm_dist:
