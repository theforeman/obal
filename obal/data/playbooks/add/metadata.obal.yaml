  Add a new package from an upstream repo to a downstream one.

  Typically this is used to copy a package from `foreman-packaging` to a downstream product repository. It's currently not possible to add a vanilla new package to `foreman-packaging`.

  To add a new package from upstream, start by adding an entry to `package_manifest.yaml` in the appropriate section (server, client, capsule, etc):

    my-new-package:
      upstream_files:
        - "my-new-package/"

  The minimum fields required are the package's name and upstream_files which lists files to copy from the upstream repository. Entries in upstream_files can be file paths, or directories (denoted with a trailing slash).

    obal add my-new-package

  If all goes well, you should have a new directory in packages/ containing the spec and any sources.

  Sometimes `add` won't work due to your new packaging being in a non-standard location (in EPEL, for instance) then you'll need to do everything that add_package.yml does manually.

    1. Create a directory for the spec and source(s)
    2. Download the spec and source(s)
    3. Add any binary source(s) using git annex add
    4. Edit the spec setting the release to 1
    5. Scratch build your package with obal scratch new-manually-added-package
    6. If your scratch build is successful, then please commit your additions and submit an MR.
