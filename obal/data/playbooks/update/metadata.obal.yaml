  Update a package to a newer version

  The newer version is either taken from an upstream repository or can be given via command line options.

  To update a package to a new version from the command line:

    obal update mypackage --version 3.4.5

  To update a package to a new version and create a git branch for the change from the command line:

    obal update mypackage --version 3.4.5 --commit

  Updating a package that is taken from an upstream repository assumes that the package_manifest already defines the upstream location. Thus, the command line to update to a newer version that is available upstream automatically is:

    obal update mypackage
variables:
  version:
    help: Optionally update to an explicit version. When unspecified, the latest version from the upstream will be used
  release:
    help: Optionally set the release. When unspecified, the release will be set to 1
  prerelease:
    help: Optionally set the prerelease macro. When unspecified, the prerelease macro will be removed
  changelog:
    help: Optionally set the changelog. When unspecified, an entry will be generated
  commit:
    help: When true, creates a git branch and commits the update changes to it.
